* Open Unity on your computer and sign in with your Unity ID ([or make one](https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/8d4556d5-138a-4b0a-9a49-bb6d350e569a012f) and then sign in with it). You'll have to go through a couple of survey/profiling screens :/ doesn't take too long, though
* Clone this repo locally
* In Unity, "Open", navigate into the top-level directory of the project, and select "Open". The project should import and open

# Running the starter code
* Go to Assets > Scene and open the "Demo" scene
* Click the Play icon at the top of Unity
* If the game does not load correctly, try fixing it by going to File > Build Settings and change the "Target Platform" value. It shouldn't matter what you change it to, and you can change it back to its original value, there is just a bug that is fixed by changing it.
